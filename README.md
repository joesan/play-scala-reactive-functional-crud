A reactive CRUD web application that demonstrates pure functional data types

1. Use ADT to define the domain model
2. Keep side effecting behaviors to the edge
3. Embrace asynchrony as much as possible
4. Support multi database paradigm
5. Expose application metrics as part of the API
6. Demonstrate "Streaming capabilities" - I'm using the Monix library
